Abstract:       scrlfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                provides the ability to execute commands before or after
                loading files, classes, or packages. It can even
                automatically load one file, class, or package in place of
                another or prevent a package from being loaded. It also
                provides the ability to execute commands before or after
                closing the main aux file during \end{document}. It has
                been used by the KOMA-Script classes for more than a
                decade.
