Abstract:       scrlayer-scrpage is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It provides an end-user interface to scrlayer to
                define and manage page styles. This end user interface is
                sufficiently compatible to scrpage2 that users should easily
                be able to switch from the old scrpage2 package to the new
                one. Nevertheless, it provides several new features to control
                headers and footers.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.
