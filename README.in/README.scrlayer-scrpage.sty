Abstract:       scrlayer-scrpage is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle.  It provides a end user interface to above
                scrlayer, to define and manage page styles.  This end user
                interface is as much compatible to scrpage2, that users
                should easily be able to switch from the old scrpage2
                package to the new one.  Nevertheless it provides several
                new features to control the page headers and footers.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages you may use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but with several
                other classes, e.g., the LaTeX standard classes, too.
