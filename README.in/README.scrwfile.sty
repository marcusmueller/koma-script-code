Abstract:       scrwfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  TeX
                provides only about 16 write handles available by \newwrite.
                With LaTeX not only the aux-file but each helper file like the
                toc-file, the lof-file, the lot-file and files like raw
                indexes and raw glossaries need one of those handles.
                scrwfile provides facilities to avoid all the handles of the
                helper files, that use the aux-file for intermediate writing.
                This means, that toc-file, lof-file, lot-file and files of
                packages like listings don't need a write handle anymore.  So
                the user will have more write handles for files like indexes
                or glossaries and may avoid `No room for new \write' error
                messages.

                scrwfile also provides facilities to clone helper files, e.g.,
                this may be used to have two tables of contents with different
                tocdepth settings.
Requires:       scrbase - some basic features for class and package authors
                tocbasic - basic features for helper files and lists of floats
                scrlfile - control of package dependencies
