Abstract:       scrwfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  TeX
                provides only about 16 write handles available by
                \newwrite.  With LaTeX not only the aux-file but each
                helper file like the toc-file, the lof-file, the lot-file,
                and files like raw indexes and raw glossaries need one of
                those handles.  scrwfile provides facilities to avoid all
                the handles of the helper files, that use the aux-file for
                intermediate writing.  This means, that toc-file, lof-file,
                lot-file and files of packages like listings don't need a
                write handle anymore.  So the user will have more write
                handles for files like indexes or glossaries and may avoid
                `No room for new \write' error messages.

                scrwfile also provides facilities to clone helper files,
                e.g., this may be used to have two tables of contents with
                different tocdepth settings.
