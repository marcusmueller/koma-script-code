Abstract:       scrhack is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                patches other packages to make them work better and adds new
                features to improve their interaction with KOMA-Script. One
                main feature is to make them work with tocbasic instead of
                KOMA-Script's deprecated float list interface. Currently,
                patches for float.sty, floatrow.sty, (old versions of)
                hyperref, listings, and setspace are available.
Requires:       scrkbase - internal KOMA-Script package with basics
                tocbasic - features for helper files and float environments
                xpatch - extending etoolbox patching commands
