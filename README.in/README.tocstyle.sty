Abstract:       tocstyle is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                When the main classes of the KOMA-Script bundle were created,
                their author had several ideas for formatting the table of
                contents and lists of floats, but almost none of them were
                implemented. One reason was that the KOMA-Script author
                didn't like to change the LaTeX kernel in a class, because
                this could result in several problems with other packages.
                The package tocstyle will fill the gap. If it conflicts
                with another package, you can simply decide not to use it.

                The current release is only a proof of concept.
