Abstract:       tocstyle is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                While the main classes of the KOMA-Script bundle were made,
                there where several ideas for formating the table of
                contents and lists of floats, but almost none of them where
                implemented.  One reason was, that the KOMA-Script author
                didnâ€™t like to change the LaTeX kernel at a class, because
                this may result in serveral problems with other packages.
                The package tocstyle will fill the gap.  If it conflicts
                with another package, you simply may decide not to use it.

                The current release is only a proof of concept.
