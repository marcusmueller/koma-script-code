Abstract:       Many LaTeX classes, including the standard classes, present 
                the user with the largely fixed configuration of margins
                and type area.  With the standard classes, the
                configuration determined is very much dependent on the
                chosen font size.  There are separate packages, such as
                geometry, which give the user complete control, but also
                full responsibility of the settings of typearea and
                margins.

                KOMA-Script takes a somewhat different approach with its
                typearea package.  Here the user is given several
                construction setting and automatization possibilities based
                on established typography standards in order to help guide
                him or her in making a good choice.
