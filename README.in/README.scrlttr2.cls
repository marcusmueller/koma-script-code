Abstract:       scrlttr2 is a letter class for LaTeX2e that allows
                definition of several note papers and text area settings,
                that are independent from the note paper.  So you may not
                only use KOMA-Script package typearea to define the text
                area and the margins of the text area, but even packages
                like geometry.

                The positions of the elements of the note paper may be
                changed by so called pseudo lengths. This makes it not only
                possible to adjust scrlttr2 to local conventions, norms and
                paper sizes but also to a wanted corporate identity.

                Several predefined parameter sets, called letter class
                option or lco-files, are for two German letters, Swiss
                letters, US letters, Japanese letters, and French letters
                are part of the KOMA-Script bundle.  More may be found on
                CTAN or the KOMA-Script homepage as separate packages.

                Additional lco-files for different note papers may be found
                on the KOMA-Script homepage, e.g. one demonstration file
                for a note paper similar to the one of the Washington State
                University.
