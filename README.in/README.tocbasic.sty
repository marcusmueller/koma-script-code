Abstract:       tocbasic is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  The
                main purpose of package tocbasic is to provide features for
                authors of classes and packages to create their own tables or
                lists of contents like the list of figures and the list of
                tables, and thereby allow other classes or packages some
                measure of control over these. For example, the tocbasic
                package delegates control of the language for all these tables
                and lists of contents to the babel package. Thus changes of
                language will be automatically reflected inside all these
                tables and lists of contents. Using tocbasic will free
                authors of classes and packages from the burden of
                implementing of such features.

                KOMA-Script itself uses tocbasic not only for the table of
                contents but also for the lists of figures and tables
                mentioned previously.
Requires:       scrbase  - KOMA-Script package for some basic features.
