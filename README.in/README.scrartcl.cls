Abstract:       scrartcl is a LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It is
                the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement of LaTeX standard class
                article.  It provides all options, environments, counters,
                lengths and commands of the LaTeX standard class article, 
                but also several additional options, environments, commands
                etc. to make it much more versatile.  The default layout of
                scrartcl differs from article with emphasis on typography.
                Nevertheless by changing the defaults a layout very similar
                to the layou of the standard class may be accomplished.
