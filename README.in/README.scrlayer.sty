Abstract:       scrlayer is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                Users may already know a kind of layers from packages like
                eso-pic or textpos.  scrlayer is another package, that
                provides background and foreground layers, but in
                difference to those other packages, these layers are part
                of the page style definition.  With this you may simply
                switch between usage of layers by switching the page style.

                In short words: The page style interface of scrlayer
                provides commands to define layer-stack-based page styles
                and to manage those layer stacks. 

                Nevertheless using the layers directly is recommended for
                advanced users only.  End user interfaces for beginners or
                average users are provided by additional packages, that
                load scrlayer on their own, e.g., scrlayer-scrpage.
