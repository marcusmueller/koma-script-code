Abstract:       scrlayer is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                Users may already be familiar with a type of layer from
                packages like eso-pic or textpos. scrlayer is another package
                that provides background and foreground layers, but unlike
                those other packages, these layers are part of the page-style
                definition. With this package, you can easily switch between
                the layers used by switching the page style.

                In short, the page-style interface of scrlayer provides
                commands to define page styles based on a stack of layers and
                to manage those layer stacks. 

                Nevertheless, using the layers directly is recommended for
                advanced users only. End-user interfaces for beginners or
                average users are provided by additional packages, that
                load scrlayer on their own, e.g., scrlayer-scrpage.
