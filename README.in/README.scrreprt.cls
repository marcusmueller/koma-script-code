Abstract:       scrreprt is the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement of LaTeX
                standard class report.  It provides all options,
                environments, counters, lengths and commands of the LaTeX
                standard class report, but also several additional options,
                environments, commands etc. to make it much more versatile.
                The default layout of scrreprt differs from report with
                emphasis on typography.  Nevertheless by changing the
                defaults a layout very similar to the layout of the
                standard class may be accomplished.
