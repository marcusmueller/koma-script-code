Abstract:       scrpage2 is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides facilities for changing the contents of page
                headers and footers.  You may either configure a predefined
                pair or page styles similar to headings and plain or
                myheadings and plain, use a simple user interface to define
                completely new page styles or a more complex expert
                interface to have more effective degrees of freedom in
                defining new page styles.

                scrpage2 also provides simple options and commands to
                decide, e.g., whether or not the running heads should be
                done automatically, which headings levels should generate
                automatic running heads, whether or not there should be
                horizontal lines above or below the page headers and
                footers, to change the colour or font of the page headers
                and footers (and the lines) and more.
