Abstract:       scrlayer-notecolumn is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle.  It provides a end user interface to above
                scrlayer, to define and manage note columns.  Those note
                columns are somehow similar to margin note (see LaTeX
                command \marginpar or packages like notecolumn), but you
                may use several of them.  The package provides page breaks
                inside note columns and synchronization points between the
                main text and note columns.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages you may use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but with several
                other classes, e.g., the LaTeX standard classes too.
