Abstract:       scrlayer-notecolumn is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It provides an end-user interface to scrlayer to
                define and manage note columns. Those note columns are
                somewhat similar to marginal notes (see the LaTeX
                command \marginpar or packages like notecolumn), but you
                can use several of them. The package provides page breaks
                inside note columns and synchronization points between the
                main text and note columns.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.
