Abstract:       scrdoc is an internal LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                It is an extension of ltxdoc.  KOMA-Script uses scrdoc for
                the implementation documentation and the documentation of
                packages, that aren't KOMA-Script core packages.  Currently
                there isn't any user manual for this class, because the
                only user is the KOMA-Script maintainer.
Requires:       ltxdoc   - the LaTeX2e source documentation class
                scrartcl - the KOMA-Script article class
