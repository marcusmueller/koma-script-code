Abstract:       scrbase is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides some basic functions used by KOMA-Script, that may
                be used as well by authors and users of other classes and
                packages.

                First of all it provides an extended key=value handling,
                that may be used for run-time options of classes and
                packages.  Several packages of a family may share options
                and all the options of one family may be changed with a
                single command.

                Additional conditions like \ifundefinedorrelax, \ifpdftex,
                \ifVTeX, \ifpdfoutput, \ifstr etc. are provided.  
                Definition of most of them may be prevented from being
                defined and have additional internal representations that
                may be used by package or class authors.

                It also provides commands to easily define or change
                language dependent terms and that work not only with babel
                but with other packages like ngerman too.

                It provides some commands for package and class authors
                missing in the LaTeX kernel like \ClassInfoNoLine,
                \PackageInfoNoLine or \l@addto@macro.

                Last but not least it provides commands for integer
                division and integer modulo operation, that may be used,
                e.g., inside \numexpr ...\relax or with \ifnum.
