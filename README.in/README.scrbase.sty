Abstract:       scrbase is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                provides some basic functions used by KOMA-Script, that may be
                used as well by authors and users of other classes and
                packages.

                First of all it provides an extended key=value handling, that
                may be used for run-time options of classes and packages.
                Several packages of a family may share options and all the
                options of one family may be changed with a single command.

                Additional conditions like \ifundefinedorrelax, \ifpdftex,
                \ifVTeX, \ifpdfoutput, \ifstr etc. are provided.  Definition
                of most of them may be prevented from being defined and have
                additional internal representations, that may be used by
                package or class authors.

                It also provides commands to easily define or change language
                dependent terms and that work not only with babel but with
                other packages like ngerman too.

                It provides some commands for package and class authors
                missing in the LaTeX kernel like \ClassInfoNoLine,
                \PackageInfoNoLine or \l@addto@macro.

                Last but not least it provides commands for integer division
                and integer modulo operation, that may be used e.g. inside
                \numexpr ...\relax or with \ifnum.
