Abstract:       scrlayer-fancyhdr is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It uses KOMA-Script package scrlayer to redefine
                the page styles of package fancyhdr as layer page styles.
                This allows the combination of features of fancyhdr with
                features of scrlayer.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.
Requires:       scrlayer.sty - KOMA-Script package
                fancyhdr.sty - third party package
