Abstract:       komamarks is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                Sometimes the LaTeX mark commands \markboth, \markright,
		\leftmark, \rightmark are not enough to generate the running
		heads for a wanted layout. Even KOMA-Script package scrlayer's
		extra commands \lefttopmark, \leftbotmark, \leftfirstmark,
		\righttopmark, \rightbotmark and \rightfirstmark are maybe
		not enough, e.g., if you want not only the chapter and
		section in the heading, but maybe also the number of the
		subsection.

                Package komamarks provides commands to handle the extra marks
		of Îµ-TeX with commands similar to the usual LaTeX commands and
		the scrlayer extension. And it provides commands to extend
		these two part marks (left and right one) to multi part marks.

                The package is fully compatible with scrlayer and
                scrlayer-scrpage.
