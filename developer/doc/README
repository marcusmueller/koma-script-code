Some Notes for KOMA-Script Developers only
==========================================

Making a New BETA Release:
--------------------------

- Change and commit scrkernel-version.dtx to set a new beta version number.

- To update the ChangeLog simply call:

    PREPARERELEASE=true make bindist

  This should abort with an error because of BETA or RC string at version
  information.

- Call:

    make bindist

  This will create a new komascript-*.zip with the binary distribution.


Making a New Release:
--------------------------

- Call:

    make clean

- Change and commit scrkernel-version.dtx and scrkernel-compatibility.dtx to
  set a new non beta version number.

- To update the ChangeLog simply call:

    PREPARERELEASE=true make bindist

  or

    PREPARERELEASE=true make ctandist
  
  for a CTAN distribution.

  This will create a new komascript-*.zip with the binary distribution.

- Change and commit releaselist.txt.

- Change and commit scrkernel-version.dtx to get a new beta version number.
