Abstract:       Many LaTeX classes, including the standard classes, present 
                the user with the largely fixed configuration of margins
                and type area.  With the standard classes, the choice is
                limited to selecting a font size. There are separate packages,
                such as geometry, which give the user complete control over,
                but also full responsibility for, setting the type area and
                margins.

                KOMA-Script takes a somewhat different approach with its
                typearea package. Users are offered ways to adjust the design
                and algorithms based on established typographic standards,
                making it easier for them to make good choices.
