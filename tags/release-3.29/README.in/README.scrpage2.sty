Abstract:       scrpage2 is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides facilities for changing the contents of headers and
                footers. You can configure a predefined pair of page styles
                similar to headings and plain or myheadings and plain, use a
                simple user interface to define completely new page styles, or
                take advantage of a more complex expert interface to have more
                effective degrees of freedom in defining new page styles.

                scrpage2 also provides simple options and commands to
                decide, e.g., whether or not the running heads should be
                done automatically, which headings levels should generate
                automatic running heads, whether or not there should be
                horizontal lines above or below the headers and footers, what
                colours or fonts should be used for the headers, footers, and 
                separation lines, and more.
