Abstract:       scrwfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. TeX
                makes only about 16 write handles available for \newwrite.
                With LaTeX, each auxiliary file, not only the main aux file
                but files such as the toc file, the lof file, the lot file,
                and the raw indexes and glossaries need one of these
                handles. scrwfile provides facilities to avoid using
                handles for auxiliary files that use the main aux file for
                intermediate writing. This means that the toc file, the lof
                file, the lot file, and files of packages like listings no
                longer need a write handle, so the user will have more write
                handles for files like indexes or glossaries and can avoid
                `No room for new \write' error messages.

                scrwfile also provides facilities to clone auxiliary files,
                e.g., to have two tables of contents with different tocdepth
                settings.
