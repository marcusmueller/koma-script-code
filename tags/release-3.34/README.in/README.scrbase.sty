Abstract:       scrbase is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides some basic functions used by KOMA-Script that can
                also be used by authors and users of other classes and
                packages.

                First, it provides extended handling of key=value pairs
                that can be used for run-time options of classes and
                packages. Several packages in a family can share options,
                and all the options in a family can be changed with a
                single command.

                Additional conditions like \ifundefinedorrelax, \ifpdftex,
                \ifVTeX, \ifpdfoutput, \ifstr etc. are provided. Most of
                them can be prevented from being defined and have
                additional internal representations that can be used by
                package or class authors.

                It also provides commands to easily define or change
                language-dependent terms that work not only with babel but
                with other packages like ngerman too.

                It provides some commands for package and class authors
                missing in the LaTeX kernel like \ClassInfoNoLine,
                \PackageInfoNoLine or \l@addto@macro.

                Last but not least, it provides commands for integer
                division and integer modulo operation that can be used,
                for example, inside \numexpr ...\relax or with \ifnum.
