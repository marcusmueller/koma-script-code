Abstract:       scrreport is a very simple wrapper class to scrreprt. Is has
                been made, because several younger KOMA-Script users doe not
                understand the 8.3 name scheme.

                However it is still recommended to use scrreprt instead of
                scrreport.
Requires:       scrreprt.cls - KOMA-Script class
