Abstract:       tocbasic is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  The
                main purpose of package tocbasic is to provide features for
                authors of classes and packages to create own tables or
                lists of contents like the list of figures and the list of
                tables and thereby allow other classes or packages some
                types of controll about these. For examples package
                tocbasic delegates language control of all these tables and
                lists of contents to package babel. So automatic change of
                language will be provides inside all these tables and lists
                of contents. Using tocbasic will exculpate authors of
                classes and packages from implementation of such features.

                KOMA-Script itself uses tocbasic not only for the table of
                contents but also for the already mentioned lists of
                figures and tables.
Requires:       scrbase  - KOMA-Script package for some basic features.
