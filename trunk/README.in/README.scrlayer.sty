Abstract:       scrlayer is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  Users
                may already know a kind of layers from packages like eso-pic
                or textpos.  scrlayer is another package, that provides
                background and foreground layers, but in difference to those
                other packages, these layers are part of the page style
                definition.  With this you may simply switch between usage of
                layers by switching the page style.

                In short words: The page style interface of scrlayer provides
                commands to define layer-stack-based page styles and to manage
                those layer stacks. 

                Nevertheless using the layers directly is recommended for
                advanced users only.  End user interfaces for beginners or
                average users are provided by additional packages, that load
                scrlayer on their own, e.g., scrlayer-scrpage.
