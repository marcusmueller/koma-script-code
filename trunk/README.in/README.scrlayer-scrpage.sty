Abstract:       scrlayer-scrpage is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                It provides a end user interface to above scrlayer, to define
                and manage page styles.  This end user interface is as much
                compatible to scrpage2, that users should easily be able to
                switch from the old scrpage2 package to the new one.
                Nevertheless it provides several new features to control the
                page headers and footers.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages you may use this package
                not only with KOMA-Script classes but with several other
                classes, e.g., the LaTeX standard classes too.
