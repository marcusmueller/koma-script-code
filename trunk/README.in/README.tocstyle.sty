Abstract:       tocstyle is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. While
                the main classes of the KOMA-Script bundle were made, there
                where several ideas for formating the table of contents and
                lists of floats, but almost none of them where
                implemented. One reason was, that the KOMA-Script author
                didn’t like to change the LaTeX kernel at a class, because
                this may result in serveral problems with other packages. The
                package tocstyle will fill the gap. If it conflicts with
                another package, you simply may decide not to use it.

                The current release is only a proof of concept.
